										<h2><a>Pastor Chris’ Teaching at the Night of Bliss Ghana 2016</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>The extraordinary teaching ministry of the man of God, Rev. (Dr.) Chris Oyakhilome, was at the LIVE disposal of the nation of Ghana at the Night of Bliss concluded just a few hours ago.<br/><br/>
On the subject of the Christian’s call to fellowship with God, Pastor Chris elucidates the true purpose of Christ. “Salvation from sin was a means to an end; the Savior didn’t come so He would be a Savior. The end purpose was fellowship…oneness with God,” the man of God said.

</br><br/>
As everyone in the various auditoria listened with rapt attention, there was a visible transformation in their countenances as the glory increased on their lives.

<br/><br/>
Pastor Chris says, “We are not in the covenant; we are children of the covenant!”

</br><br/>
Addressing tens of thousands in the nation of Ghana, the man of God, Rev. (Dr.) Chris Oyakhilome, clarified the difference between being in a covenant with God and being children of the covenant.

</br><br/>
The man of God explained that the believer is an heir of the covenant, which entitles him or her to certain blessings, for which they need not pray. “Prayer is not for getting things from God…it is our wonderful, highly exalted communication with our Heavenly Father, in this glorious fellowship,” he said.
