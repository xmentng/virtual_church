										<h2><a>Pastor Chris’ New Year's Eve Service Ministration</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									Inciting the crescendo of the phenomenal New Year’s Eve Service, the man of God, Pastor Chris, led the attentive congregation of millions all around the world in the exhaustive reading of the scriptures in Psalm 92 vs. 1-15.<br/><br/>
“2017 is the year of Flourishing,” Pastor Chris profoundly proclaimed, setting off everyone from the edges of their seats unto a glorious atmosphere of out-bursting tongues, ceaseless shouts of victory, dancing and other extravagant displays of overwhelming joy, which filled the LoveWorld Convocation Arena and other viewing centers around the world. It was the word everyone had been waiting for!
</br><br/>
The message of the year is more than a topic. It is an insight into what the Lord will do for us, in us and through us - it is God's direction for us. Times and seasons don't apply in heaven but in the earth.

<br/><br/>
<b>Three Key Things To Note:</b>

</br><br/>
<b>1. My Year of Luxuriant Growth.</b>
Notice the verse above it says, they shall flourish like the palm tree. The palm tree flourishes irrespective of seasons. Its leaves are evergreen. And some grow very tall. One of the features of flourishing is spreading. Which means the spreading continues 

</br><br/>
<b>2. My Year of Significant Attainment.</b>
Attainment of higher heights. God wants to do marvelous things through us. Not just attainment but significant attainment (news making attainment).
</br><br/>
<b>3. My Year of Persistent Productivity.</b>
The weather, economy, country and physical circumstances do not count. "So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed."

                                   </p>
         <p>
         	<b>What does God want you to do?</b>
         	</br><br/>
<b>1. Speak in tongues like never before. </b>
This is the refreshing by which you cause the weary to rest.
</br><br/>
1 Corinthians 14:4 (AMP)
When you speak in tongues, your spirit becomes sensitive to spiritual realities.
</br><br/>
Jude 1:20 (AMP)
Your most holy faith means your most sanctified faith (the highest faith you ever expressed - faith that had no doubt - your purest faith). Build on that faith by praying in the Holy Ghost. Speaking in tongues therefore purifies your faith.
</br><br/>
Why was Paul so successful? 1 Corinthians 14:18 "I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"  Speaking in tongues is important for the Christian to be very successful.

</br><br/>
<b>1. Speak in tongues like never before. </b>
</br><br/>
Hebrews 11:1-4 "...Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear..."
</br><br/>
The word of God talked about in the scripture above is talking about the Rhema of God and not the logos of God (the logos of God made all things). The Rhema of God is talking about how things work around you. This is the revelation received from God spoken through our mouth.
</br><br/>
How 2017 will be your year of flourishing is in your mouth. The word has been spoken and as such the rest of 2017 must comply.
