													<h2>WHAT IS FOUNDATION SCHOOL?</h2></p>
													<p>In foundation school, members are taught the basic doctrines of Christ. They’re equipped for the work of the ministry. The Bible also admonishes us not to be children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 4:14). Hence, the importance of equipping and perfecting the saints in these last days cannot be overstated.</p>
 
<p>Knowledge is vital, and it marks the difference between success and failure. To have a successful Christian life, you require the basic knowledge of God’s Word. And that’s why we invite you to join the foundation school, because at the foundation school, you’re taught the basic doctrines of Christ that’ll prepare and position for the higher life in Christ.</p>
