                    <p>
                        For 15min at 12noon and 10pm (Local/GMT), we'll pray mostly in the spirit, and also pray for ministers of the gospel around the world, that the work of the ministry will continue to prosper in their hands unhindered. Pray also that they be delivered and protected from wicked and unreasonable persons; the Lord causing them to walk in perpetual triumph and victory in all situations to the glory of His Name. Pray fervently in tongues. God bless you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p> Prayer is primarily our communication with the Lord. Communication has pur-  pose, and the purpose usually determines the mode and relevant details for the  communication to be effective. 

                    <br/>The disciples of Jesus were Jews and they knew how to pray religiously. After  walking with Jesus for a while, they realized that Jesus didn’t pray as they did. He  actually had results continually in a way that startled them. They finally said to the  Master, “Teach us to pray.” 

                    <br/>Many have had their understanding of prayer distorted by “religion” and wrong  teaching. As a result, they have difficulties changing their misconceptions on even  fundamental truths about prayer.

                    <strong><p>Why We Pray</p></strong>

                    Praying is such an important part of our lives as Christians. First of all, we must  recognize prayer as a privilege as well as an honour. Every moment of prayer is an  investment in eternity and true prayer is a romance of righteousness. Our fellow-  ship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. Through prayer we partic-  ipate in the communion of the God-kind; it’s a throne-room caucus rendezvous: 
                    Jesus made it so! Oh, that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened to see  this awesome truth and that we may walk in the light of it! What a time of rich  communion with the Lord prayer provides us!

                    <br/>Scripture enjoins us to pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Prayer helps  to season our spirits as a dependable receptacle for God’s Spirit and power. Then  we can connect to His ideas, visions and leadings more easily in order to change  the world.

                    <br/>When we pray, we make tremendous power available, dynamic in its working,  causing changes in our favour. Certain prayer sessions are specially designed by  the Lord to help straighten out things in the spirit-realm regarding our immediate  or later future as individuals, families or ministries. How wonderful that we can  change circumstances and alter destinies in His Name through prayer! We serve a  kind, loving, great and gracious God who daily loads us with benefits (Psalms  68:19). During times of prayer, we can meditate on His goodness and appropriate  these benefits to our life’s circumstances.

                    <br/>It is God’s earnest desire to have a rich, vibrant and enduring fellowship with His  children;but how can they enjoy such communion with Him if they don’t know  how to pray effectively? This is one of the many reasons He impressed it upon me  to write “HOW TO PRAY EFFECTIVELY” and share with you some vital truths and  principles of effective prayer. This first volume will help establish for you a clear understanding of the rules of different prayers for different situations and how to apply them for your desired outcome.

                    <br/>You can expect your prayer life to be revolutionized as you open your heart to receive and practice the divine insights that will be unveiled to you.
