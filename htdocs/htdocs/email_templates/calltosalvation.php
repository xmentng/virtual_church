This book is loaded with information and teaching that will give you quick  understanding of who you are; a Child of God. </p>
<p style="line-height:150%">Remember,  now that you are Born Again, its important for you to start having fellowship  with other believers like yourself. The Bible says in Hebrews 10:25 that we  should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, but that we should  exhort, encourage and build up on another.
